**Letters of Recommendation**

AP Calc BC (11th), Honors Spanish 4 (11th), AP Physics C (11th). I've known all of these teachers for at least 2 years, since I had them for pre-requisite classes during 9th and 10th grade, and I've received As in their classes while maintaining a good relationship with them (participated in class, hardworking, focused)

**Interviews**

Had interviews for MIT and Stanford, both went well as I was able to have fun conversations with my interviewers about various topics (MIT talked about random topics that came up during conversation, Stanford had pre-made questions that directed the conversation)

**Essays**

I talked about different aspects of my personality (Red Cross, airplanes, photography, CS and tech in general). My personal statement was based on my obsession with airplanes when I was younger and how I hope to use a CS degree to aid in aerospace development.

**Additional Information:**

Can’t believe I even got off UCLA's waitlist considering what I’m majoring in, but still really excited. I was going to SoCal regardless, but I guess I’m going to be living in Westwood now! I guess this could be a lesson in anything being possible, especially for waitlists. One day you could wake up in the morning at 6:45am and get an acceptance into your dream school!"
