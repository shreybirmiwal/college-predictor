**additional information:**
""
*weaknesses:*
""
"* low stem grades as a stem applicant. most of my below-a grades were in math and science. my school is quite tough, though, so it wasn't *that* bad."
"* contrived essays (mainly for mit/early schools/non-""why school"" essays). i think part of my success with uchicago was because i didn't  submit those typical leadership/community/etc prompts."
* largely underwhelming ecs. no national competitions or ivy league internships. you get the picture.
""
*strengths:*
""
* stats. these definitely helped me at my state school and safety school with honors colleges/scholarships.
"* interdisciplinary profile (for uchicago specifically). i know they look for students who want to study many subjects across the academic board, so my ecs and classes that focused on both humanities and stem were probably appealing."
"* women in stem maybe??? i don't know if that's so much of a hook, but i had multiple ecs that strengthen the point."
""
*final thoughts:*
""
"i couldn't be happier with my decision to switch from the rd to the edii pool after being deferred ea from uchicago. i don't think i would've been accepted without the ed bump, so even though i wasn't 100% confident in my decision then, i would choose it again in a heartbeat. i think i'm a great fit for the school, so i'm glad my application profile ended up showing that."
""
"looking back, i'm surprised that my frankly mediocre ecs landed me a spot at a \~t10\~. combined with my lack of awards or 4.0 gpa, my acceptance seems like a miracle to me. at my school, i've seen students who are honestly much smarter than me get waitlisted and denied at top schools they would flourish at. originally, i felt competitive about college applications. i wanted to go to the best college out of my class to ""prove"" my worth to my peers. looking back, i was an idiot. i couldn't be more grateful for my acceptance, but hearing about rejections and "

"i mean again no way to evaluate these for sure lol but i think they were pretty good. i spent a lot of times on the hypsm ones and less on the others, but that might just be because they had fewer questions. my cc seemed to like my supplementary essays tho for the most part but got conflicting opinions on the personal statement. personal statement focused on interdisciplinary connections and how that inspires me to not be complacent in my understanding, i.e. a project i did applying machine learning to music. looking back on it it was a bit scattered tbh. it could just be coincidence but even before i got results back i always thought my stanford supplements were the best."

""
*videos for uchicago and brown: i did not do these at all.*
""
**essays**
""
"main personal statement: 9/10, my common app essay was an auto-bibliography about my experiences being ostracized by both western and muslim peers as a muslim trans person. i wrote about how i've taken this opportunity to better myself and take direct in my world to change for myself and resist falling into the spiral of depression and failure society wants to force on people like me. overall i would say this was a 9/10, it was very well written, emotional, and intellectual. i spent several months polishing this. in the end i probably had somewhere around 30 versions."
""
"supplementary essays: 9/10, i rarely reviewed my supplements after the first few. however i'm more of an on-the-spot writer and can writing a good essay without needing to edit it much. this definitely saved me a lot of time. i also focused a lot more on actual ideas and plans for the future rather than invigorating and pretty prose. considering i applied to about 15 schools, i didn't spend much time on these."

"sorry i'm kinda lazy on the extracurriculars. if anyone wants to learn more, ask in a comment or pm and i'll probably reply."

"visited some colleges in southern california last spring and figured out i like smaller schools, but still got sucked into applying to some big ass schools lmao. imo the smaller liberal arts schools are kinda overlooked and there are a lot of hidden gems. for example, grinnell is an amazing kinda prestigious liberal arts school with a super generous financial aid office, if u dont mind living in a cornfield. all jokes aside, idk where im going w this.  sometimes i'll start a sentence, and i don't even know where it's going. i just hope i find it along the way.  - michael scott"
""
"basically, i'm a lazy/procrastinating shotgunner who got pretty lucky. i was gonna apply to all those rd schools but i didn't even start on their essays by the start of december lmao. even dropped umich and usc before november 1st cus i was too lazy to write those long ass mf essays. dropped ut austin and tamu cus i was lazy as well lol. dropped tulane as well cus counselors told me abt their non ed policy which they basically accepted over 90% of their class ed and everyone applying ea or rd were just sol. so dropped that."
""
harvey mudd and nyu were rly a shame cus i think they were the best academic schools for math and applied math but i was right off their recruiting standards for both of them so the coaches couldn't offer me any pull. ngl would have applied to either of those ed if i could play my sport there. and i'm like 80% sure i would have gotten into nyu for ed regardless.
""
"if i were to do it again, i maybe woulda been more risky to see where i coulda got in else where, but i really got sold on colorado college when i took an athletic visit there in the fall. crazy thing is that i never even heard of it until this spring when i attended a zoom presentation covering like a lot of liberal arts schools. visited in july and basically loved it."
""
word of advice for ppl applying in the future: there is basically always light at the end of the tunnel and you'll probably find a school that is a good fit for you. don't worry about where so and so is applying or what expectations you rly have going into the process. and don't be discouraged by failure and

"lor 1 - ap chem teacher - loved him, i hope he loved me, i used him for my isef project and alot of other stuff, and he seemed very interested, he’s known to write good rec’s so id say 8/10 being conservative"
""
"lor 2 - us history teacher - only non ap history i took but he was genuinely so amazing of a teacher, he liked me, i read his rec since he let me, it was pretty good 6/10"
""
"lor 3 - ec#1 research mentor - old guy who really liked me and said he specifically tailored my rec for mit and caltech whatever that means \[he sent 4 people to mit over the past 4 years so ig he knows\], love him sm and he said he spent a really long time on it so hopefully 9/10."
""
"lor 4 - counselor - i talk to my counselor alot and i think she likes me alot, and she’s super super nice so i’m just going to say 7/10."
""
​
""
***interviews***
""
"mit - spent 3.5 hours, my mom lowk got annoyed, but it was amazing he told me about a new way to think about space time, mit experience, hacking and everything, met him later at admit day for our region and he said he really enjoyed the interview and expected me to get in. 9/10."
""
"harvard - he said i would “fit the modern school” interview went for 45 minutes, got him to talk about some illegal stuff he did @ harvard but he cut it off when zoom ran out so not sure how good, felt like i vibed. 6/10."
""
"stanford - went really well, the ao note later said she described me as a genius apparently so that’s cool, we talked alot and she had done isef i think in the past and we talked about our memories alot and in general it was fun. 9/10."
""
duke - pretty mid tbh it was fun and nice but i had no answer for why duke 5/10
""
"uc berkeley met - disaster, this is not a one on one, but you record yourself answering questions, i really didn’t care since i came back later had 1 day to do this and was tired, just chatgpt’d some random stuff about the school and said it reading straight from a script, super uninspiring answers read in an uninspiring way (tbf i wasn’t interested in met since it meant my parents might force me to go there over stanford) 1/10"

​

***essays***
""
"(*briefly reflect on the quality of your writing, time spent, and topic of main personal statement.)*"
""
"i nearly failed apel and i’m not known to be a great writer, so ​i dropped all my ec’s senior year to focus on essays, after being warned by a guy @ davidsons that essays mattered way more than i thought they did. watched every video from admitium tiktok to cc posts and hundreds of reddit threads to get ideas and help. i got help from my friends and also a really cool family friend @ harvard who got praised for writing alot. my essays were very nontraditional and very very casual and i talked about lots of mitish stuff (dream school), which also happened to fit for caltech. everyone who read my ca said they liked it, and my harvard friend who got in purely for essays (his note said) rated them really highly said he liked my essays, but i don’t think they were the main driving factor for my acceptances so i’ll rate them 7/10 (like everyone else on this forum). "
""
"since i didn’t have to tell the colleges how much i loved researching or science bc my awards and ec’s displayed that already, i spent most of my essays talking about fun stuff i liked doing, and nonacademic stuff, trying to talk about myself as a person and not as a college applicant/sweaty high schooler."
""
"i didn’t try on my duke or columbia or nu essays at all, i templated my why essays really hard and just swapped in names, but i did copy paste my mit essays into duke which i spent almost 100 hours on. i tryharded my mit stanford caltech and harvard essays, and i’d rate them 8/10, while my other schools (including uc’s) were much much worse probably 3/10 or 4/10."

"the difficult conversation one long-form (400 words) was balling, again probably carried. but when i went to fill out other schools' supplementals who had the same or similar prompts but lower word counts, i just scaled the original down badly and it lost much of what made it good originally. so 400 words 9/10, shorter ones 5/10."

"* **upenn seas committed**: lowkey the perfect school for me! i always wanted to pursue a combination of cs and business (which is why michigan is my second choice above the likes of goergia tech) and there is no place in the world better for that combo than upenn. so so excited, and i plan to visit on quaker day! only downside is that i'm going to miss all of my friends a lot. the nearest ones are going to be at jhu and harvard (and maybe one staying in new york on a gap year?) but i look forward to the chance to meet new people, i'm sure it's gonna be an amazing time 😁😁😁"

**essays**
""
"i spent so much time on these. i poured my entire heart and soul into making sure they reflected my passions, goals, and overall just who i was as a person. my biggest tip is to start early, especially if you’re applying to so many schools. i knew i was an extremely slow writer, always needing to put lot of thought into my words before i could afford to write them out, so i budgeted accordingly. i began working on my personal statement in july, started my supplements in august, and was working up until the january deadlines. for me, it really helped to read a bunch of examples online (thank you collegeessayguy), so that i knew how to tackle each school’s supplements. that being said, be careful that the examples don’t confine your ideas or limit your voice. also, please do not overthink your personal statement. i know a bunch of people who started panicking about their personal statement days before the deadline and scrambled to rewrite it in a matter of days, but trust yourself, you’re likely overthinking. "
""
"my personal statement was about my linguistics journey. my supplements varied, but i basically tried to write about my hobbies in a unique way. what’s funny is that i picked a controversial/political topic for the princeton/duke/brown difficult conversation essay, but i got into all three???"
