be engaged in ecs from your first year of high school. do your best to try to win awards in them to show your dedication.,2
"be careful of your time management. grades are the most important thing, and your ecs are worthless if you get poor grades. i seen this to some of my peers. for college admissions, good grades means straight as in as many aps as possible.",2
ask for help if you are struggling. ask your counselor and teachers for opportunities that are available in and out of school.,2
"participate actively in every high school class and be nice and respectful. help your peers that are struggling. don't be selfish. not only will it help you learn and get good grades, but it will give your more options for lors. teachers talk, and your reputation will follow.",2

"so i feel so lucky to have been accepted to so many schools and i am currently deciding between emory and bu (please give me some advice on what to pick i am truly struggling) and i am going to keep myself on the gw wl because i think it's crucial to be in d.c seeing what i want to study and how  networking is super important for that specific job field. last week i toured bu and emory + oxford, and i am just really conflicted on what to pick. both have a lot of tradeoffs, and i know i'm in a very privileged conundrum, but i'm honestly losing sleep over this choice.",1
"also, i know the amount of schools i applied to is quite excessive, however at the end of the day i'm really grateful i shotgunned since emory was a bit of a spur in the moment application for me, and now it's one of my top choices to attend! i never would've thought i actually would get into a school like that, so if attending a highly competitive school is your goal, i say shotgun the hell out of your app if you are able to. college apps are just too random nowadays. i honestly lost so much hope after getting rejected by uf back in february, but i am so surprised and satisfied with how things have turned out. i wish the best to the class of 2027, we made it out alive 🥳",1

"and when picking schools, visit them if you have the time and resources (ask the college to fund your plane ticket) after you get in. the \~vibe\~ of the school is the most important and just feeling your emotional and visceral reaction when you are on campus and interacting with current and future students is the most telling factor of where you belong.",1
"advice for future applicants: be as creative as possible in essays, and try and have fun while writing! i think the schools that i got into were ones that i had the most fun writing - the stanford roommate essay and the penn thank you note were my favorites. if you have fun, you come off as more genuine and i think it somewhat humanizes this crazy process and you stand out more. i got really caught up in my essays because i applied to so many schools, and i just started sounding like a robot in a lot of them.",1
"i'm extremely happy with how things turned out - going to a super competitive bay area school has been super hard and pressure-cooker-esque. i think that really contributed to the caliber and number of colleges that i applied to. i've really given into this capitalism a lot the past few years and participated in a lot of extracurriculars, but i never felt like i did it just for college. i did a lot of things because i wanted to lead a meaningful life and use my time effectively.",1

"latin teacher (8/10). i had her for two years, and since i excelled in her classes and showed my true interest in latin language/literature, i think she definitely liked me. she wrote my rec letters for a bunch of summer programs, which i was accepted to, so i’m assuming it was decent.",1
"research professor (9/10). i’d been working with him since the end of tenth grade, so he was able to speak to my academic abilities, work ethic, and excitement about research. he told me he wrote that my work and character was comparable to his graduate students — was very touched to hear that.",1
"tbh, i thought all my interviews were just okay, not really that special. most of them lasted for the allotted time and nothing beyond. i did go in prepared with responses to the typical, as well as questions for the interviewer.",1
"i spent so much time on these. i poured my entire heart and soul into making sure they reflected my passions, goals, and overall just who i was as a person. my biggest tip is to start early, especially if you’re applying to so many schools. i knew i was an extremely slow writer, always needing to put lot of thought into my words before i could afford to write them out, so i budgeted accordingly. i began working on my personal statement in july, started my supplements in august, and was working up until the january deadlines. for me, it really helped to read a bunch of examples online (thank you collegeessayguy), so that i knew how to tackle each school’s supplements. that being said, be careful that the examples don’t confine your ideas or limit your voice. also, please do not overthink your personal statement. i know a bunch of people who started panicking about their personal statement days before the deadline and scrambled to rewrite it in a matter of days, but trust yourself, you’re likely overthinking.",1
"my personal statement was about my linguistics journey. my supplements varied, but i basically tried to write about my hobbies in a unique way. what’s funny is that i picked a controversial/political topic for the princeton/duke/brown difficult conversation essay, but i got into all three???",1

"my advice to all cs applicants, please focus on your essays a lot. they are what make you stand out, which is especially important in such a competitive major. make sure they show your personality, your goals, and who you are beyond a computer screen. also another thing is that you don't need to grind olympiads and ""do it all"" to have a shot. do what you are passionate about and let it show through your application and essays.",1

"looking back, i must admit that i was arrogant. i thought would be able to get into at least one of the ivy+ schools. it was when i got rejected from all ucs that my stats were not comparable to other applicants. still, i was very fortunate to get accepted into some good cs schools like umd and ut austin.",1
"it was actually hard to see myself getting rejected from more schools while my friends kept getting accepted. i still remember the shitty feeling i had when i saw the reaction video posted on ig of my friend who got accepted to half ivys. this was actually tough and stuck in my mind even after graduation. but, after i met many successful people in my country through the summer break, i realized that what makes these people different from normal people is the number of failures they've experienced. probably, some of you reading my post won't get into your dream school. don't feel bad about this. every successful person experiences a very hard time in their life. the more you fail, the stronger you become. you can endure more difficult things that those who never fail cannot overcome.",1
i've been at ut austin for almost three months now. i cannot express enough how happy i am here. everyone i met was super nice and i even made more friends than i did in my entire high school in this short time. the cs class i'm taking now (cs314: data structure) is very challenging but rewarding.,1

"p.s.: all you high school juniors that are stalking this! (yes i know youre there, i was one of you!) the best piece of advice i can give you is… just get off this sub, go out there, and try something new. i got most of my awards my junior year just because i wanted to go out and explore something i hadn’t before, not just for college, but for myself. so please! just leave, explore the world and find your passion, and all this worrying of “ecs and awards” will disappear. from talking to kids who have done isef or usamo or whatnot, this is their exact mindset - don’t “grind:” do what you like, and the ecs will come to you.",1

applying to get into certain types of colleges has its limits just like applying sideways (my advice is to do a bit of both).,1
don't get attached to any institution until results come out.,1
"do not let a few unfortunate results hurt your confidence. keep shooting, keep going. you got this dawg.",1
find a good friend group that's there to support you (support them the same way too).,1
showing your personality is key in your writing and presentation of yourself.,1
understand a human is reading your application in a limited timeframe. adjust your application accordingly.,1
"apply honestly. (this is directed at my cs majors.) if you want cs, apply for cs. don't try to mess around and apply as a different major with the intention of switching. if you get cold feet with committing to a major, go undeclared.",1
celebrate. every. win. (i cannot stress this enough.),1
"also, don't let my results make you justify procrastinating. while i left nearly every application to the last minute, it wasn't without an established plan beforehand. the schools where i truly rawdogged the application in the final hour did not go well.",1
"this fall, i'm taking my talents to a place i've always had an admiration for (probably because a few of my closest friends have graduated or are in the school) but felt i wouldn't be a fit there because of the sheer size of the institution amongst some other factors. i am incredibly glad to have received the early notification from cal, because it allowed me to really explore the university and helped me realize that i will belong here. i'm totally aware that eecs will be a hustle in terms of the work, but i'm up for the challenge and can't wait! go bears!!!",1
"november update: it's almost been 3 months here. it's been nothing short of an experience. who knew you can be academically challenged at an academically challenging school with one of the most academically challenging majors in this school?! the adjustment from high school to college is no joke. all i will say is to embrace change and not be so attached with immediate results. i have had to change my mindset and time management approach to maximize my time here both academically and socially. while not linear, i'm glad to be progressing and getting a grip of this place. things have a really funny way of figuring itself out so let things play out. cal was the place i needed and i'm glad i'm here.",1
"i want to end this long post with this: do not attribute your value to what happens in college admissions. this is a process where not a ton is under your control. the moment you send your application is the moment you let go of control over what happens. the decision is not in your hands. treat it as such and embrace wherever you end up choosing. i've seen enough students at cal not fully embrace their school and it's something that does nothing but hurt you. embrace where you are and make the most of it. if there's one takeaway i want you to take, this should be that one thing.",1

a little reflection:,1
"honestly i was genuinely shocked by the fact i got into any uc or freaking uiuc for ee (!!) considering the fact i didn’t take ap calc bc or ap physics. i only applied for funsies, just to toss my hat in the ring. i remember literally opening the portal while i was on the toilet and my jaw dropped.  unfortunately they didn’t give me any financial aid. $60,000 for one year is a lot and it’s not worth it long term financially imo, but hey, if it was grad school it’d be a much different story. maybe it’s the impostor syndrome speaking because i would hardly call ee my passion. i changed my mind last minute to this major so i kinda just got here without trying hard for it.",1
"my top 3 i was deciding between was davis, uiuc, or santa clara university. i was really considering scu because it has very strong industry ties, they’re very well funded, and they gave me enough financial aid where it was the same price as a uc. but i also live 10 minutes away from it and i wanted to be out of the house for my own character development. i felt like i wasn’t appreciating what i had, and i needed to spend some time away from home so i could come back with a newfound appreciation.",1
"i ended up committing to uc davis because it’s far enough from home where i can be independent but i can also come back easily when i need to, and i like the vibe of the campus. it’s not competitive, everyone’s pretty laid back and friendly. solid reputation, not as prestigious as uiuc but finding internships won’t be terrible. it’s boring in sacramento, sure, but as an ee student i’m probably going to be indoors a lot of the time.",1
"i have never been a very ambitious person. sometimes i think about if i should have applied for more competitive schools and given the t20s a shot, but after visiting a lot of them, i had this really deep gut feeling that i just don’t fit in with the campuses and the student body. i’m not sure how to describe the feeling, but a wave of dread washed over me. like i genuinely felt like i would go crazy or get depressed. it seemed a little too far away from me. i’m happy with uc davis.",1

breakdown by type of application:,1
"if you told me about my outcomes in august of last year, i'd be incredibly surprised. i assumed my questbridge application would be strong enough for me to match somewhere and the only thing i'd have to worry about in winter break would be senioritis. that absolutely was not the case.",1
"instead, this college apps journey has been incredibly humbling but also validated my grind at the same time. there were so many ups and downs, but in my case, it worked out.",1
"i will say that despite the results of my questbridge application, i have zero regrets about doing the match, although i would alter my strategy slightly for the match itself. for questbridge hopefuls watching this, please do not get fixated on matching with schools. questbridge rd is an opportunity to not be overlooked (most of you will get into an amazing institution through rd) and so is the community around this program which has been nothing but amazing. i have a lot of reflections about questbridge and plan to post more about them in the r/questbridge subreddit in the coming weeks.",1
"an overarching thing about this process that applies to everyone applying is that so much of your college application hinges on the support system around you. i am incredibly grateful to have had supportive parents who were willing to spend time with me to work through this process. i am incredibly grateful to my counselor, teachers, and matriculate advisors for helping me out tremendously in my development as a student and a person. i am incredibly thankful to have a friend group that always was in my corner but also kept me accountable.",1

(the second is not studying my freshman year but thats a different story lol). i already made a plan for myself next year for transferring. i know i should try to enjoy the school i'm going to right now, but i definitely owe it to my amazing parents to try to cop at least one near full-ride scholarship to a top school.",1

here’s what i should have done:,1
"1. your context matters!!!  both your life circumstances and where you come from. for me, i showed a lot of resilience🤓 ☝️ throughout my life, especially for academics. if i were less determined or did not have the goal of wanting to have a normal life and go to college and pull girls or whatever shit redditors do, i would not have clawed myself through high school and woulda just dropped out fr. also, if i applied to top schools in my area instead of on the other side of the country i probably would have been steamrolled because i am competing against my entire school as opposed to almost no other applicants from my school 💀.",1
"\- only applied to oos schools with automatic scholarships and good merit aid (unlike uga, w&m, etc.).",1
\- spent more time on my merit scholarship applications to private schools. merit aid from fancy private schools is rare.,1
\- applied to less than 10 schools.,1
\- completed more research about money on the front end.,1
"i’m going to my state school for free. i’m grateful for all the opportunities i have been given, and i know this was god’s plan for me. future applicants, remember that no college can take away your hard work. you will end up where you are supposed to be.",1

tips,1
some things that might really be helpful for anyone reading this!!,1
"deadlines: the coalition application will let you apply to an unlimited number of schools, and since you submit your writing supplement separately, you can often complete them after the application deadline, sometimes up to a month late. i didn't complete my duke or rice writing supplements. without me asking, duke extended my deadline to feb. 1 and gave me a fee waiver, and rice extended mine for about a week; tufts also extended my deadline to jan. 31. i'm definitely not trying to encourage anyone to submit everything late, but sometimes things happen.",1
"fly- in programs- if you apply to schools' fly-ins, it will count majorly for demonstrated interest and some will give you fee waivers, even if you aren't accepted (rice and washu). it's also a really fun experience as they tend to cover your travel expenses and provide housing, food etc, and you can get a feel for the campus and meet new people!",1
3. carnegie mellon,1
"i definitely would do a lot of things differently if i could go back in time...i started the whole process really late, a little bit in the spring of my junior year and then really starting to in the fall of my senior year. i also got burned out when trying to complete supplements for more competitive schools, and would often hit a dead end and wonder ""why am i even trying with my stats?"" and lo and behold, i left them incomplete. if i could do it again, i would have stopped worrying about the things i couldn't control and put forth my best effort to make what i could control the best that i could. i hit a mental block several times throughout the process and was very exhausted by the end.",1
"as someone with adhd i do get really disorganized with school, and i was never really someone who was the top of the class in grades and was never really a stem- heavy person: my grades were typically a-s in english/history classes and bs in stem classes.",1
"since i have a high test score and lower gpa, i felt that i couldn't really predict where i would get in, contributing to me applying to so many colleges. i also didn't know if i wanted to go to a lac or a university, which was another contributor. i'm very lucky that the application fees didn't pose a significant burden to me and am incredibly grateful that i received the opportunities i did.",1
"i hope this information helps someone in the future (coming from someone who spent way too much time procrastinating scrolling on here lol), and congrats to everyone this year on app season almost being over!",1

"when i was rejected from oxford in my last year of school, i hadn't applied to the us. i figured i should in my gap year. i realise in retrospect, though, that my application was probably always angled towards oxbridge/uk unis more than the us. my real strengths and 'spike' always surrounded my intended major/subject of history and writing abilities, with other extracurriculars pretty mediocre by ivy standards.",1
"for this reason i don't think my application for aid mattered much - my application probably wasn't enough for ivy+ even had i not applied for it. and our need was negligible/non-existent: we applied, as above, in order to be eligible for applying for aid later (at all the non need-blind places) should our circumstances change. i don't know in the final analysis how much impact it had, really - any thoughts?",1
"however, if anyone - particularly future applicants - is interested in learning more about the oxbridge application process, please pm! as someone who has been through the process twice and received both decisions (with the 'yes' from the better one, i would argue!), i feel i can give at least a little guidance on things like ps/ucas/interview prep/entrance exams/college selection and strategizing.",1

"also, am probably gonna appeal my aid for duke and brown, as i had a change in family income, so those costs may go down to around a full-ride post-appeal since the drop was pretty large (under 60k per year total family income) since they're really generous with their aid.",1

final thoughts & advice:,1
"well, clearly,  this whole application process is so random. i didn't get admitted into any ucs except santa cruz, davis, and berkeley, so who knows what's going on there. getting wl at irvine was also strange, but oh well. ensure you apply to enough schools, but ensure your essays are in tip-top shape—they must be genuine!!",1
"i'd like to mention that using chat gpt for general research on schools is an underrated tactic. it genuinely helped me figure out the vibe and idea behind all of these schools and saved me countless hours of research. definitely use it, but don't abuse it (chat-gpt essays are garbage).",1
there are a couple of things i wish i had done differently during this application season and in high school in general.,1
"1. gpa: your gpa is vital to you getting through their initial filters, and if you look at almost any college's common data set, they value gpa to the max. on a 4.3 scale, my gpa was actually below average for many of these schools, and this was due to 2 bs in math and english. an engineering major having a b in math isn't exactly a good look, so it is imperative that you are acing the classes your major is directly related to.",1
"2. ec list: i believe your ec list is as important as your essays. framing a good ec list is terrifying, to be honest, and in my ed/ea round, my ecs came out as pompous and over the top. reframing everything for the rd applications helped me come across as more genuine and a real human. don't fluff up your hours!!! nobody can work 18 hours a day, and aos will be extremely suspicious seeing so many hours but a disproportionate amount of impact.",1
"3. essays: be genuine. don't try to act like you're writing a paper for your final english exam. this isn't going to be graded on a scale of 0-100 for formality and grammar, but the aos will be grading your personality, who you are, and how you'll fit into their next class. if your essays aren't realistic, truthful, and clear on why you want to go to that school, you won't have much success.",1
"as for where i'll commit, i have no clue yet. check back in a month, and i'll have updated this post. feel free to drop your thoughts; deciding between cmu, berkeley, and dartmouth is not something i am looking forward to.",1

"commonapp essay (6/10): it was probably an ok essay, obviously good enough to get me into some really good engineering colleges, i just never felt very confident about it. it was about my experience at my 4th grade spelling bee. basically, i said that from defeat i learned that the knowledge i gained and work ethic that i formed was more important than the trivial materialistic reward i had sought after (a trophy), and i talked about how i applied this to my love for computer building years later. sounds like a weird topic, i know, but it was executed better than in this short summary. i feel that it had a good message, but the writing style and overall sophistication left much to be desired. due to my terrible procrastination and temporary burnout i was experiencing during the application season, i had about a week to write it, so i wasn't able to get it sounding as good as i wanted to (shout out to my sister for helping me revise it though).",1

"this decision was definitely one of the hardest ones i have had to make in a long time. i really do love uiuc and purdue, and they are both fantastically compelling in their own way. with the two colleges being so similar in nearly every aspect, it often felt like there was no deciding factor that could point me towards one or the other. i am very fortunate and grateful to be in the financial position where the cost of college was not a big factor in my decision, and with uiuc and purdue being extremely similar in almost every other regard, i ended up largely making my decision based off the vibes of each college. after getting the chance to visit both colleges during my spring break in march and after weeks of thorough research afterwards, uiuc just started to feel more and more ""right"" (purdue will always have a place in my heart, though). i wish i could elaborate more on this feeling, but to be frank, i myself don't really know what about uiuc made it feel like the better fit for me over purdue.",1

"some of you may be wondering why i didn't apply to some more selective colleges like umich, georgiatech, ut austin, and cornell, as i got into all of the schools i applied to and may have had a chance at those other colleges. i'll do my best to explain. initially, i actually did have all of those colleges on my list. i had planned on applying to 11 colleges in total, though during the college application season itself that list shortened to what it is now. there are two reasons for this. for one, during september and most of october i struggled to manage the work from my classes, extracurriculars, and college applications. despite having little to no social life because of covid, it was very difficult to handle 6 ap classes and a plethora of extracurriculars, making it hard to find the time to even think about college applications. secondly, i began heavily doubting my abilities after becoming quite obsessed with subreddits like r/applyingtocollege and r/chanceme. combined with my procrastination, i told myself that i didn't have a chance at those other colleges, so i shouldn't even bother applying and should instead focus my limited time on the colleges i had a shot at. very stupid methodology, i know, and unfortunately i do kinda regret my choices. though, i ended up getting into my top two dream schools anyways, so thankfully everything worked out in the end.",1

"do research beyond just rankings: this might be an obvious point, but i feel like nowadays people overlook aspects of colleges like the student body population, weather, and demographics etc. and just blindly look at what us news tells you the top 10 colleges for your major are. i know of a lot of current college freshmen and sophomores who dread their college because they can't stand the weather or don't like the feel of bigger colleges. i recommend taking a lot of time to determine what kind of college you really want. if you've lived in a warmer climate all of your life, going to a college up north is going to be a big difference, and that's definitely something to consider.",1

"overall, given my stats (unweighted gpa + class rank) being less than from what i’ve seen as ideal for my major and demographic, i feel like i did decently. however, as we get closer to decision day, i am still incredibly torn between which school to choose. i’ve identified the university of michigan and the clemson honors college as my two best options (michigan being the highest ranked cs program i got into, and clemson honors college on a return on investment basis).",1
"while cost is not an issue, as even michigan wouldn’t change my family's quality of living, thinking in terms of return on investment, i’m not sure if i would gain the roughly $45k in tuition difference by going to michigan. additionally, i'm not completely sure how applicable michigan's cs prestige is to me, as my major is housed in the college of literature, sciences, and arts (bs-granting), opposed to the college of engineering (bse-granting).",1
"while i'm currently leaning towards michigan and my solely-prestige-focused asian parents are supporting this, seeing the sheer amount of high-achieving peers vying for the clemson honors college is making me feel extremely convoluted, and as it gets closer to decision day, increasingly dread picking the wrong option.",1

"even though cs was an absolute bloodbath this year, i am pretty satisfied with my results and my overall tenure in high school. i tried to balance doing stuff for college and stuff that actually interested me (mainly robotics lol), and i honestly didn't start thinking about college til the second half of junior year. i didn't really meticulously plan out a path to the top schools and design my life around college which i feel like really helped me just enjoy life throughout the whole application process. my advice for future college applicants is to try and just enjoy high school as much as you can - for sure keep college in mind, but please don't make it your whole purpose in life or else you'll hate yourself. besides, admissions is really random and you can't control everything, so don't bother trying to. in jean-luc picard's words, ""it is possible to commit no mistakes and still lose. that's not weakness. that's life."" so yeah, don't sweat it, just do what you enjoy and you'll end up fine. thanks for reading, and cya!",1

im shocked brother 😭😭 i dont have the discipline to pursue what im not interested in (as you can tell from my ecs) so i can confidently say that even if i had got rejected from everywhere i wouldnt feel like i wasted four years of my life or whatever. attending a t20 has never been super important to me but im really fortunate to have received the results that i did,1
reflection/advice:,1
"1. the college admissions process can be unpredictable but it isn't random: your essays, personality, and extracurriculars are extremely important. there are tons of people on this subreddit with extraordinary qualifications that definitely are capable of performing well at a t10 school, but many don't gain admission. my best advice to anyone is focus less on maximizing your awards/ecs and focus more on enjoying what you do. throughout high school, i've found great enjoyment and fun in all the activities i participate in. your essays should reflect that you are a genuine person who has a personality outside academics—what do you do for fun?, are you kind to other people around you?, are you curious?, etc.",1
"i'm going to end this section off with a translated quote from one of my favorite movies of all time (3 idiots): don't pursue success; pursue excellence, and success will follow. i think this perfectly encapsulates my experience with college admissions. i've found that the common theme between several hypsm admits i know is that they didn't care about college admissions until their senior year; instead, they focused on being excellent at what they enjoyed doing. if you do the same, there's a higher chance (although not guaranteed), that you will land one of your top choices.",1
"if you want help in the admissions process, finding research, or tutoring, feel free to private message me, i'd love to help :)",1

additional info/final thoughts (important):,1
extra things that i thought would help me stand out:,1
"also i was the only person to have dual enrolled in math, after literally running out of math courses to take at my already competitive high school. diff eq was no joke, but it was a really useful class and i did very well.",1
purdue (rd) didn’t accept spot,1
took every double period and ap science course at least one year ahead of my peers.,1
"i also talked extensively about traveling to asia in my gap year, and how that i utilized my language skills to interact with people. i talked about how it has opened me to new perspectives and how interacting with communities broadened my outlook.",1
"so yeah in the end college admissions cooked me to a crisp. besides my unremarkable personal statement and (possibly) mediocre counselor rec, i really can't understand what went wrong. maybe this year was just too competitive with test optional policies, and i'm pretty sure there are kids with <1400 sats from my school who went to and got into top schools. also i will say that evidently top schools couldn't care less about your course rigor, at least beyond a certain amount. they don't care that you took ap physics c in elementary school or can speak 10 languages. i went in with the mindset of ""all it takes is one"", though i guess even that was too much to ask for :/ anyway, my #1 piece of advice?",1
"apply early. seriously, i think this was my biggest downfall. i can't believe i didn't learn from my first application cycle, but too late to change that now. this applies especially if your school regularly sends students to top schools. it doesn't matter if you have new stuff that you want to show by the regular decision deadline. you can always update stuff in your portal later. if you apply rd, universities may already have selected their share of students from your school. honestly given how uchicago heavily pads their yield, i might have been accepted had i went ed there. or maybe jhu. i don't even know :/",1
"i will say though, i think purdue was an interesting outlier. even though their engineering program is quite competitive (especially oos), they specifically reached out to me and asked for my cc dual enrollment grade which no other university did. i think that compelled them to offer me admission, and turning them down was a really hard decision that i still don't even know was the right move. i am extremely grateful for that though.",1
"still, i'm honestly feeling quite lost considering all my work, but looks like i might just go to cc atp. what makes it even worse is that it's looked down upon by every person in my school community and even by my parents and relatives. at least i'll save money right?",1
"also remember if you're reading this and you didn't get into a top college, do not be discouraged. this sub has an insane amount of response bias, titles like ""clutching an ivy"" or ""scores a miracle"" just aren't representative and you shouldn't compare yourself to them. not everyone gets a satisfactory outcome and you aren't alone. for the sake of your happiness, if you're applying to top universities, just expect to get rejected from all of them. don't bank on getting in to one of them even if you think you are special or extraordinary in some regard. chances are that they just don't care. and unless you think you can do something remarkable in a gap year, don't take one just to reapply. it's just not worth it.",1
"anyway, vent over. it doesn't really matter anyway, i'll crush those transfer apps 😌",1

closing thoughts:,1
"i would be lying if i said i wasn’t disappointed in my results this cycle. i was hoping for at least one reach school, and only ended up getting into one target. coming from a school that only sends 1-2 kids to a t20 every four years i thought would help give me an advantage, but ig not. in terms of test scores i was in like the top 5 in my grade, and only one other kid ended up going through this cycle, but he managed to sweep some really good schools like northwestern, usc, notre dame, and princeton. i felt like i did enough to get into a super competitive school because founding clubs and doing research is practically unheard of at my school. i may end up going through this cycle again next year as a transfer student but i’ll cross that bridge when i get there. ig i also thought karma would help me out a little lol, but turns out it’s not like the ao’s see me taking charge of my health and losing weight :/",1

two of my college advisors told me to not commit yet one of which told me im better off going to mercy since its the cheapest and the other told me to wait for better offers,1
another two told me that the only way to close that gap is by applying for scholarships (which i am doing),1
i wont get much for fasfa either according to my mom and aunt since my mom works as a nurse. (i mean i can legally marry my partner of 2yrs so i could qualify for more money /hj),1

[write-up]:,1
"i didn’t really expect to get accepted into anywhere but the csu that was closest to me (iirc, some csus offer priority admission to students who go to nearby public high schools) and maybe get an offer from the uc statewide guarantee program.",1
"while i do have a good gpa, i didn’t stand out at all. i am an asian interested in cs. i wasn’t offered the most challenging aps available at my school, i didn’t have any awards, or any stand-out extracurriculars. i didn’t have a lot of leadership opportunities, nor had i participated in any volunteer opportunities. i hadn’t had any friends my first 2 years at school, nor had i really kept up with the opportunities my school provided, so what i mainly had to show for myself was what i did out of interest.",1
"so getting accepted into some excellent universities really shocked me. especially with the ucs since they review applications holistically. i don’t know what those ucs saw in me, but maybe i’m clouded by how i see myself and my achievements.",1
[tip]:,1
"if you are a california resident, do not, and i mean do not sleep on the csus. a couple of people i know have only applied to the ucs and while they definitely got into one, they were taking an unnecessary risk.",1
"many of the ucs are some of the most applied-to colleges in the nation. even if your stats give you a good chance of getting into one, it’s not a guarantee that you will get into one.",1
"if you would rather attend a csu instead of being a cc to uc transfer, i would highly recommend you apply to the csus, especially if you have a fee waiver. they’re great colleges on their own right, are usually less costly than a uc, and are primarily focused on teaching undergraduate students which might suit you better over a uc (and which also appears to be why they rank lower on national rankings).",1
"applying to 4 csus takes only about an hour (this does not include eop), and is totally worth it if you still want to attend a university after high school.",1

overall i know my grades and extracurriculars were definitely lacking but i think i wrote pretty good essays (my topics were a bit cliche but were well-written imo). my advice is to really use piqs to your advantage. don't tell them what you think they'd want you to say; tell them your story!! write about something you are unapologetically passionate about! good luck to all my fellow seniors waiting on more decisions and all juniors getting ready for the hell that is college applications! :'),1

"i know the type of person who browses these a2c-related forums, so i want to say that obviously my circumstances aren't exactly the same as anyone else's, obviously i wasn't applying for the ivy league, obviously being in-state helped with getting into umich, and obviously i did have some impressive stuff on my application which helped a lot too. but i didn't really stress about college admissions until i was in the middle of doing my common app, i just lived my life and tried my best and took the opportunities that were available to me and that i was interested in. weirdly enough that might have even been a good 'strategy', since i don't think i would have done as well in theater and mun if they had just been ecs i was doing for the sake of looking good. when i look back on the past five years i'm happy for what they were to me then, as well as what they've helped me achieve now. i know what type of people browse these forums, so if you're some hs junior applying to umich three years from now, please don't let college anxieties get in the way of you living a fun life. it's important, yes, but your life now is important too. anyways, happy college applications y'all and hell yeah i got into u of m let's freaking gooooooooo.",1

"if a big part of your subpar gpa is due to freshmen year, search for colleges that don't take that year into account when recalculating your hs gpa. for instance, ucs, stanford, cmu, emory, do not take freshmen year into account when redoing ur hs gpa.",1
"for supplemtals about academic interest or curiosity, look at what the school is trying to promote (programs, new courses, etc). i saw that emory seems to trying to build its rep on ai and cs stuff, so in my supplemental about intellectual curiosity, i talked about ai and how i wanted to apply it in the medical field ( i am genuinely interested in both med and ai, don't try to fake your interests)",1

"i submitted a music portfolio to almost all the schools that accepted it but it was pretty mid and i could've devoted more time to it, i didn't think it adequately represented my abilities",1
"in conclusion, the college application process is a cancer and you couldn't pay me to go through it again. please take care of yourself and make time for the things and people you love. finish out high school strong and enjoy going to school and learning. compartmentalize: don't work on or think about your applications even in your spare moments in class. you'll eventually start doing it when you're supposed to be paying attention. don't take a full schedule senior year if you plan to apply to a lot of colleges.",1
"i truly did what i could and i'm happy with the things i devoted my time to in high school (aside from a few bad decisions socially but that's neither here nor there). i couldn't have gotten better grades, better test scores, or even better ecs because i didn't do anything just for college admissions. if i were to analyze where i could possibly have improved my application, i can think of two main areas",1
"i devoted a lot of time to music activities and didn't see many returns in the form of achievements that would be impressive to colleges. i could have maybe spent this time doing research/more stuff related to my intended major. i say maybe because there's really no way of knowing what i would do with more time. also i read like 100 books in high school so like i could have made time by not doing that either or i could have just used my music time to read more books haha. either way, i wouldn't be the person i am without music and it's been one of the most enriching experiences of my life",1
i didn't build strong enough relationships with my teachers. i was an incredible student but for the most part did not make an effort to have a relationship with them because it just wasn't my personality to do so. i do think i could have built stronger relationships and been more conscious of the teachers i asked to write my recommendations instead of just picking the ones i thought colleges would like to hear from.,1
i think it's pretty easy to lose sight of what's important in this process. learning is what i love and i'm going to continue that no matter what college i attend. this is just one day in a long life! honestly this process was kind of fun and exhilarating at times too,1
i don't know if all this is too deep but i hope it's helpful to someone lol. happy to answer questions if you have any (also any advice on which school to pick would be helpful),1

\\final thoughts\\,1
i (somewhat embarrassingly) cried a lot this application cycle. from stress of applications to getting deferred early to the stress of scrambling to find more rd schools to getting rejected a million times to the stress of waiting... combined with a smorgasbord of non-school related personal issues that just kept popping up... suffice it to say my water intake has skyrocketed lol.,1
"to future classes: my biggest advice is whatever you do, pleaseee at least start the majority of your rd essays before your early decisions come out. no matter how busy you are with school, personal life, whatever, i promise you it is infinitely more miserable trying to get everything done when you have to combine all that with the dejection from getting rejected from a dream school... totally not speaking from experience...",1

"ik some ppl might say it was mainly aa, i genuinely think being from a low income school helped a lot more bc you’re evaluated with the context of the resources given to you and i used majority of the ones given to me. but idk, def race could’ve helped w “building a diverse class”, but it wouldn’t change an app from spongebob into sheldon cooper. i don’t really know for sure what got me in, but i know that people in previous yrs w similar ecs who don’t benefit from aa have gotten into t5-t20 too.",1
"in no way am i an expert and my advice should be taken w a grain of salt, but i still wanna offer some!",1
"the obv is getting good grades/test scores and participating in good ecs. idk abt spikes and what not, but i think it’s good to have some ecs towards one thing and some towards others (not a complete jack of all trades and not a complete eggs in one basket). for example: if you’re interested in science i think it’s good to make sure that not all of your classes are stem/all ap scores are stem and all 10 spots and 5 awards are stem related.",1
"i think that lor/essays are the ones that make you stand out and it’s important to focus on those too. i think some good writing practice would be practicing creative writing even if it’s 2 sentence-100 word horror stories, also getting comfortable abt writing abt yourself. i found that listening to songs/podcasts etc. helped me figure out the energy i wanted to give in my essays. a2c has excellent writing resources too !",1
"for lors i think these are rlly important as well, try to develop real relationships with the ppl you will ask. try to have real conversations with them outside of just school, ask them for advice and show interest in their classes as well. if possible without sacrificing quality, try asking teachers who teach different fields (stem vs humanities) to show a wider perspective of who you are.",1

"personal statement (5-6/10?): not my favorite thing in the world, but probably also not that terrible? i would consider myself an okay writer, capable of expressing my thoughts in a nuanced way and proficient at basic grammar. however, i felt extremely lost writing this essay; i didn't know how to connect words and sentences in a way that would make the readers feel something. i definitely should've asked my friends for feedback earlier on; i think i was embarrassed and afraid of potentially receiving feedback that would negatively impact my self-esteem. since i didn't have a college counselor, only like... two people actually helped edit this essay oops. topic-wise, my personal statement was about reevaluating how i perceived my self-worth—a journey prompted by this crisis i had when i realized i didn't want to pursue medicine, despite organizing my entire high school classes around it. it was relatively straightforward piece that expressed this change in mindset i hoped to live by in the future. looking back now, i'm proud of the person i conveyed through it :)",1
"uc essays (4-5/10 lol): first thing first, these essays were by far my least favorite to write. to this day, i still have no idea how to approach these essays, nor do i know how important they are in the grand scheme of things. in retrospect, i was overconfident about my abilities to get into either berkeley or la, especially since it seemed like everyone who had perfect grades always did so (i ended up getting 1 b the summer before senior year during a dual enrollment class). thus, i started to believe that uc piqs weren't even that important. anyways, i tried to write how i thought my ao wanted to hear / what was expected for a cs applicant to write, and i managed to make myself indiscernible from the other 1810813x cs applicants applying. yay!",1

advice/information:,1
"as you can see, i did not have the strongest extracurricular profile. i did not have any fancy internships or international recognition. however, i think that you can get away with weaker ecs if the other parts of your application are very strong. for example, my lors and essays were probably the strongest part of my application. get started on essays very early and have them reviewed multiple times. an amazing essay will differentiate your application from the rest.",1
"also, i think it's important that you develop a theme for your application. mine was tailored around environmental science and spanish, which i think added a level of transparency and clarity. participate in ecs and courses that reflect your major and you should be set.",1
so glad this process is over!!! good luck to everyone still applying and congratulations to those already accepted as well. :),1

"overall, i applied to 11 colleges and got into 6, which i don't think is too bad. if i could do it over again, the only reaches i would apply to would be tufts, bates, and vassar. i think i applied to too many colleges that were out of my league (tbf my dad made me apply to washu) and it was kind of a waste of money. i started feeling that way after i got my early decisions back.",1
"i was super excited to get my bates decision back because i did not expect to get in, but i think it shows that lacs are actually committed to holistic review, unlike bigger universities who may tout holistic admissions but in actuality just take those who have the most impressive credentials. i don't think there's necessarily anything wrong with that, just something to keep in mind if you're an applicant like me who doesn't have the most extraordinary resume- applying to lacs might be for you.",1
decision:,1
"it's still early yet, but i am 99% sure i am committing to >!uw-madison.!< i'm grateful for the scholarships i got from some other schools, and bates and mcgill were some other top contenders, but as someone whose family doesn't qualify for need-based aid money really is king and this was one of my only truly affordable options (i get that sweet sweet reciprocity tuition). luckily for me, i loved the campus and the town when i visited and it has great programs for my major. i am super excited to be a badger next year and can't wait for all that college will bring! now it's only a matter of making it to graduation...",1

videos for uchicago and brown: i did not do these at all.,1
"main personal statement: 9/10, my common app essay was an auto-bibliography about my experiences being ostracized by both western and muslim peers as a muslim trans person. i wrote about how i've taken this opportunity to better myself and take direct in my world to change for myself and resist falling into the spiral of depression and failure society wants to force on people like me. overall i would say this was a 9/10, it was very well written, emotional, and intellectual. i spent several months polishing this. in the end i probably had somewhere around 30 versions.",1
"supplementary essays: 9/10, i rarely reviewed my supplements after the first few. however i'm more of an on-the-spot writer and can writing a good essay without needing to edit it much. this definitely saved me a lot of time. i also focused a lot more on actual ideas and plans for the future rather than invigorating and pretty prose. considering i applied to about 15 schools, i didn't spend much time on these.",1

"though my school's culture is certainly nothing compared to the bay area horror stories i see all over a2c (and sometimes the news), i sort of saw how it affected myself and others. especially in my freshman and sophomore years i sort of valued myself through academic achievements and constantly compared myself to others and noticed other kids doing the same. though a corny statement, ""comparison is the thief of joy"" applies perfectly to this process. even if you cure cancer there's going to be some dude who cured cancer and plays 3 d1 sports; if you're the 3-sport athlete that cured cancer there's going to be a guy who did the same except made it to the imo and so on. there are so many amazing applicants so why waste time comparing greatness to greatness. i'm endlessly thankful to have a set of family and friends that are proud of me for doing what i did in high school. not meeting your own or others expectations does not erase all that you've done and worked for.",1

"1. quality over quantity of ecs. even if you have a leadership role in \all\ of them, having a few very impactful, personal experiences in unique ecs that you are actually passionate about makes for better essays and overall a better high school experience.",1
"3. in the same vein, don't fall too in love until you get accepted. i am very guilty of this: i was head over heels in love with uc davis, and at the same time trying to come to terms with the very real possibility that i might not get in. luckily, i did get in, but this made the whole admissions process very stressful for me and i know it would have been emotionally devastating to get rejected. its totally fine to have a dream school, but i recommend not getting too attached until you get that confetti on your portal.",1
"4. apply to honors colleges if possible. especially if you want to continue your education after undergrad, this is a great way to get increased access to research opportunities and internships to strengthen your resume. honors colleges are a great option if you end up going to your safety. the application is usually free and the worst they can do is reject you.",1
"6. learn to live with the unknown. at some point, you did everything that you could and there is nothing more you can do except wait. this was very hard for me to accept and is easier said than done, but eventually you have to accept that whatever happens is out of your hands once you hit submit.",1
"7. don't make rash decisions. currently struggling with this as i try to decide between davis (my dream school) and santa barbara (higher ranked school, thought i wouldn't even get in). do your due diligence before you commit, even if you're pretty sure of where you wanna go.",1
8. join discord servers for your schools once you get in! met some really great people through the uc davis admitted students discord :),1

why wasn't i accepted into my dream schools? what could i have done better?,1
"1.	i didn't have a very strong ""spike."" my ecs were spread across the board in economics, visual arts, and journalism. while i did explain the causes and significance of my interest in various fields, i failed to mention why my other passions were relevant to my pursuits in business.",1
"2.	i should have considered applying for film to more schools since that is a relatively unsaturated field compared to economics. a hunch of mine is that i could have applied as a film major to northwestern and gotten in, then switched to econ. this isn't talked about very much but it definitely seems like a possibility.",1
"3.	when reviewing my application i realized that it wasn't formatted very well. even though i applied for economics to most schools, my awards were almost completely visual arts awards. even though aos say not to repeat information said elsewhere, i wish i would have omitted some of these awards and replaced them with my most significant economics/business awards so that it would be at the forefront of my application.",1
"4.	like i mentioned before, i prioritized quantity over quality which was probably a mistake given the importance of essays, especially this year. it takes time for me to put a personal voice in my essays, and for some supplements, i just did not spend enough time just researching the college rather than just name-dropping specific classes, professors, and programs. this likely showed and was the reason i was rejected from the schools i did not want to go to as much.",1
"5.	while my standardized test score is strong, my ecs and grades are both pretty subpar compared to admitted students, especially of my background. part of me blames my competitive school environment, but i also failed to reach the goals i set for myself and burnt out. in retrospect, i should have prioritized what classes and ecs mattered most to me and built my application around those strong points.",1
6.	didn't ed or rea anywhere due to a sudden change of heart (don't waste this opportunity!),1

let me just say that my unimpressive ecs/awards list is in no way indicative of my actual ability. a lot of the things i did outside of school i just couldn't include because they were too numerous or completely unprovable. it sucks that you have to have some tangible award or something in order to prove your intellectual engagement and that a frightening portion of the people i've witnessed who do get in with these shiny awards and ecs are totally faking any sort of real drive or involvement.,1

about my college list:,1
"also, you probably noticed that my college list looks like i went on usnews and picked all t20. there may be some merit to that, but really, i only applied to schools that are need blind and would give good (or at least decent) aid. it just so happens that most of the t20 and t30 institutions meet my criteria (notable exceptions including nyu, washu, northeastern, and to my knowledge, cmu). this is why i get somewhat annoyed when seeing posts about how t20 and ""prestige"" don't matter. i can totally understand why they'd think the latter, but the fact is that these ""prestigious"" and wealthy institutions are the ones that many families can reasonably afford once financial aid is accounted for. this is the same reason i didn't apply to any oos publics.",1
"one thing i would definitely account for if i had to do this whole process again is applying to more safeties. i fortunately lucked out this time around, but i arrogantly assumed that uci and cal poly slo would be safeties for sure. do not be like me. do not assume that.",1
unc — direct admit kenan flagler (ea),1
"also, i've read other college results posts, and i'm aware that i have no business being accepted to some of the schools i was accepted into. but i think what saved my sorry ass was having strong essays and an overall narrative. my application set a cohesive, deeply personal, and semi-unique narrative behind why i wanted to pursue business (social entrepreneurship+mental health+creativity)",1
"when i binged dozens of college decision videos as an underclassman, cost and financial aid was never mentioned. i wish they’d mentioned it. because due to costs, i don't think i'll be accepting my t20 offers. just something to think about.",1

"for my common essay, i wrote two versions (one for columbia (ed)), and one for all my rd. the columbia one wasn't bad per se. it was just the most possibly standard essay you can imagine. talked about first robotics, my passion for engineering, leadership, and stuff under super high stress critical thinking etc.",1

"only recently did i realize that i really should have written more about what prompted the sudden change from 10th to 11th grade. as you can see, my grades increased by 13 points, and most of my activities suddenly occurred. beforehand, i was ultra shy/introverted (like could not make eye contact, maybe spoke once each year in class).  i had to go through a shit ton to forcefully ""relearn"" to socialize, and just alot of mental health stuff. like i'd stand in front of mirrors, holding my eyes open with my fingers to force myself to make eye contact with myself. (it's kinda sad now that i think of it lmfao). basically, i forced myself to change, and took initiative etc.",1
"i think my supplements were okay for the most part. pretty standard, follow the formula type stuff. talked about my passion for things, and i tried to be somewhat unique. i think my stanford essays were by far the best, and were ultra unique lmfao. however, my columbia/mit supplements were questionable, since i wrote them without seeking any information (like websites like collegeessayguy etc).",1
"i think a major issue was with my additional information part for my columbia application. earlier, i had received some information from a dude, who recommended that i write about my great grandfather in that section. so i basically wrote it about family values, and how his dedication/work inspires me. now, it sounds decent, but someone else told me (after the deferral), that it was pretty bad, since it could definitely be seen as being self-entitled (like, oh my relatives are cool, you ashouldccept me). and since i can't edit my essays after being deferred, i was basically fucked. for my other applications, i basically used the section to detail my activities and impact more.",1

"i hope this helps any underclassmen out there! especially fellow students with disabilities or extenuating circumstances, i know it is hard to find info out there about the college app process for us so i hope this helps! i think a few schools were able to look past my outcomes during my period of enhanced extenuating circumstances, and hope this can provide some sort of relief for those of you like me. make sure if you do have these problems, you get a counselor to mention it somewhere in the letter of recommendation or something because they won't just take you for your word. i am very happy with the end results, i mean i thought i had no shot at the ucs because they went test blind but it worked out, and although i wish i could have gotten into a few more of my top choices to weigh financial aid offers, i know i am blessed to be in the position i am in.",1
all i can say is.. i got extremely lucky,1
"it will be hard, perhaps more so next season, but remember, college truly is what you make of it. never lose the passion and drive that burns within you, even when things don't seem to work out. better things are yet to come :)",1

to internationals:,1
"\- if you can, shotgun. my school only allows ten applications but i bypassed the system to apply to more (some applications to schools outside of the us don't require counselor documents). if i hadn't done that, things might have ended terribly.",1
"\- if you're asking for aid, i'm very sorry my friend, things do suck for you. please have backups outside of the us or in your home country. tons of top schools around the world would offer you scholarships to go: canada, netherlands, australia, uk (maybe not many scholarships there, but it's much cheaper), germany (language concern), singapore, hong kong, etc., there are schools with english or liberal arts programs. please do a lot of research",1
"\- there really are no safeties in the us unless it is a state school that is unaware of your financial need and accepts basically everyone with your stats. do a ton of research and don't bet on any private, need-based-aid-giving us college.",1
to all:,1
"\- start early. my common app essay took wayyy too long; i started in march, threw out everything in june, and finalized it in october. give yourself that wiggle room in case you suddenly realize your essay doesn't feel right.",1
"\- beware of post-ed burnout. based on personal experience: after the early round, i chilled a lil too much, thinking i still have time, i deserve the break, and that i might get into one of my early schools and that it's pointless to grind out rd apps. beware.",1
"\- make sure to research a lot and know what the school is mainly looking for. for rice (take w/ grain of salt cuz i still got rejected), it was community and the culture of service/care. uchi, uniqueness; yale, leadership and community. for nyuad, it was the eagerness to learn about different cultures and meeting different people. tailor your narrative and highlight personal qualities around these core ideas.",1

"physics teacher (8/10): i had him during quarantine at first. i think i was one of the few kids on zoom who always had their camera on and would answer questions. when we went back to in-person i'd usually come to class early and chat with him a bit. there was also only a handful of other girls in that class so we'd do our worksheets together, sometimes i'd help them with problems.",1
"apush teacher (5/10): uhh this one was kinda unintended,, i originally asked another humanities teacher for a letter of rec. they were planning to quit their job after my year but promised to write all rec letters that people requested. unfortunately they apparently didn't? i only heard about this in september, so i ended up having to ask another teacher i wasn't as close with.",1
"upenn (8/10): interviewer was really kind and friendly! i was really lucky bc she was involved in the arts and had a son who was doing band, so we had some things we could bond over. one funny thing though: she asked me if i applied to berkeley (i said yes bc i didn't want to lie), then told me that if i got in there i should consider it over upenn. apparently she went to berkeley for a summer program and thought that their engineering resources were better lol. too bad i didn't get into either :')",1
personal statement (6/10): tbh i'm not really sure how well it turned out. i kinda wish i had more experience writing personal narratives or just fictional stories so that it could've been more entertaining. i wrote about the pretty basic topic of getting over social anxiety through one of my ec's.,1
uc essays (7/10): i think the shorter word limit definitely helped me with conveying my voice and dry sense of humor. also the more specific prompts made brainstorming a lot easier. i wrote about some of my hobbies and expanded on my ec's. (i didn't really get a great result from the uc's so maybe these were worse actually oops),1
i think overall i probably should have spent more time brainstorming and picked more unique/interesting topics. i know writing about your ec's is pretty common but i genuinely couldn't think of anything else important that happened during high school..,1

"one of the scariest things i heard during the college application process was that aos compare you to people within your school. i have never been as ambitious as some of my peers, who started thinking about college from as early as 7th grade. i have never been as driven either; you'd think that the competition around me would push me to try harder or do better, but i was a student who was just... lost. i didn't know what i wanted to do (or didn't think i could do it), and i was too afraid to try. throughout most of high school, i stuck to the hobbies i'd always known. compared to my friends, my ecs and awards seem completely insignificant. some of the juniors i know have accomplished more than i could in ten lifetimes, lmao.",1
"maybe this just reveals my naivete, but i'm kind of glad i never fully immersed myself in the college grindset. due to that, i was able to cement my self-worth in things other than the ""prestige"" of going to an ivy/top college. but i think the lingering regret that i could've done so much more has taught me that being content with what i have isn't always the best way to go. i definitely need to learn to step out of my comfort zone more and challenge myself !!",1

"if i were to do it again, i maybe woulda been more risky to see where i coulda got in else where, but i really got sold on colorado college when i took an athletic visit there in the fall. crazy thing is that i never even heard of it until this spring when i attended a zoom presentation covering like a lot of liberal arts schools. visited in july and basically loved it.",1
word of advice for ppl applying in the future: there is basically always light at the end of the tunnel and you'll probably find a school that is a good fit for you. don't worry about where so and so is applying or what expectations you rly have going into the process. and don't be discouraged by failure and,1

"1. i never once thought that i would've been applicable to go to a good school, especially with a full ride included. at a young age, i was told i was going to be a failure by special ed teachers and i went through high school wondering if i had wasted my future by attempting to apply to college with no guarantee that i would even go through the process with good results. with that being said, i'm so grateful that the stars aligned and i was able to get matched, and no longer have to worry about my financial situation. just gotta make it through senior year! 💪",1
"3. if there's any advice i wish i'd learned during this, it's that it's best to write in the style that works best for you. in the beginning, i made the mistake of trying to write creatively and made myself look like a fool. so i just wrote in a more direct way as i usually do and my essays looked so much better. if you're not a creative writer, just know that you can still get success without having to create some fancy metaphor or being quirky.",1
"4. a2c and chanceme suck and don't help a lot. especially with the weird resentment toward urm and fgli students (seeing it here on this sub as well) that gets brought up once in a while and then ignored. if you're someone who's going to apply next year, don't make the mistake of browsing these subs daily and expecting to get good advice or to gain confidence.",1
"5. also for future applicants, apply to questbridge's national college match if you're willing to do it! yes, it's very competitive and the application process is exhausting to go through, but it is worth it whether you get matched or not! (you'll get fa similar to or exactly like fa if you got matched instead!)",1
"and lastly, be sure to go into this with confidence! it helps a lot. whether it works out for you or not, you can still be successful regardless! i know this can be taken with a grain of salt looking at my results, but it's true regardless.",1

"some thoughts on my application: honestly, a lot of this stuff is pretty unconcentrated and i don't know if i should've done what i did in high school. i never had a private college counselor or some ""one true passion"" that consumed my life so i did what i wanted, a little bit of this and that here and there. the healthcare thing probably looks weird since i don't even know if i want to go into healthcare. my application would also probably make more sense if i applied as a music major but i see music as a hobby and not something i want a career or degree in. i probably look like a weird applicant who doesn't know what she wants in life so that's definitely not helping my chances but hey i'll give it a shot :)",1

"when i got to the farm, though, something clicked. for the next one-and-a-half years, my soul bloomed like a bright yellow tapestry of canola flowers in late february. i spent my days sketching blueprints for agricultural devices, and my nights dreaming in fields of wild blueberry and yuzu. my dreams about the future of agriculture turned into my goals regarding the future of my life. in my 11th grade year, i maintained straight a+'s in seven ap classes, solely off the basis of my ambition in agriculture. every single award, every single test score, every single leadership position, every single extracurricular...they all came through my passion for agriculture.",1

"i believe essays (other than personal statement) are less important than your major/what ""new thing"" you will bring to the school. for caltech and mit your essays matter even less and your awards and achievements are above all.",1
"from the collective experiences of my friends, volunteering really doesn't help college admissions, and you should volunteer only for things you genuinely enjoy. leadership is not necessarily important, but a clear drive and dedication towards a passion is.",1
"also, cs is tough.",1
"i honestly believed that violin was a major part to my application, however i got flat rejected from, well, every school that had an arts supplement other than duke. personally, i believe the best to worst parts of my application was extracurriculars, essays, honors, arts portfolio, rec letters. the whole process of college applications was a nightmare for me.",1

"i can't wait to go to brown in the fall! i was very, very surprised at their decision--my ecs and essays weren't particularly impressive for the resources that i have available to me. if i had to guess, the biggest factor was my scattered ecs; i think i was able to effectively make a case for why this was a positive thing, especially with regard to the open curriculum. as for plme, i had a story, but i couldn't back it up with my ecs that well.",1
"again, i know it's cliché, but apply to schools that fit your interests and résumé. indeed, i don't think any t20 except for brown would have accepted me, because my application was too scattered to make a case for anything but the open curriculum.",1
"\# of honors/ap/ib/dual enrollment/etc.: 9 honors, 6 de, 9 ap courses (didn't take calc ab or bc)",1
gpa (uw/w): 3.93/4.58 (got one b and lots of a-'s),1
"overall, i'm pretty happy with my cycle. i'm grateful that i was admitted to so many great institutions, but i was really disappointed that i couldn't get into stern or any of my harder reaches but it is what it is. i'm happy to get into boston college and i'll most likely attend. leaving the door open to transferring though, since i want to get into finance and bc is not the best for placement. i'll see how i feel after 1st semester next year before reconsidering- for now i'll just work hard and enjoy :)",1
