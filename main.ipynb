      "This is a subreddit dedicated to compiling data about the undergraduate and transfer admissions processes. We intend to create a repository for information about past applicants and their college decisions, in order for current applicants to browse through examples of student profiles and potentially gauge their chances of admission to different schools and programs. We encourage all students who have received their decisions to contribute to our subreddit by creating a post using our [official templates](https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/gjgqu7/post_templates_and_flairs/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x). To all current applicants, this subreddit is a great resource for you to compare your stats with those of other students, discover ideas on how to improve your extracurriculars and overall application, and discuss student profiles via comments sections. For your convenience, we are organizing both new and archived posts with flairs, according to unweighted GPA, SAT/ACT scores, and intended areas of study. Use these flairs to easily filter through the thousands of posts on our subreddit, based on what you are looking for.\n",

The cost will be similar per year (within \\~$8000 of each other), which is not a huge factor for me, and I am only going for two or three years since I am a transfer student. I am curious what the long term-tech career opportunities would be like -- seems like short-term UW gets the advantage since it is in Seattle. Which would you choose specifically for that factor (excluding things like social life, weather, food, campus, etc.)?\n",

      "One of the things that I felt helped me with my application was that I had received an Econs/business and finance-related scholarship despite not taking Econs in school (in the A-Levels system,  a vast majority of ~90% of students take Economics and I was one of the only students in my school not to do so), and with a clear narrative and financial aid sorted out, it really did help me through the process.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the end, what worked for the 1 US school I got into was that my narrative of wanting to contribute back to SG through my field of work in my bond tied in very well with Huntsman's program for international business (since I may be stationed overseas (possibly Tokyo) to do econs/business and finance-related work under the government), with the added benefit that my extracurriculars and personality didn't fit the archetype of a \"Wharton kid\" at all. Coupled with a strong liking towards Japanese culture personally and through the foreign language programme, and talking about how I explored international cultures through composition and music, and my active involvement in MUN and the humanities programme, really fit the International Studies component of Huntsman. \n",
      "\n",
      "Advice:\n",
      "To all applicants, you can do it! I personally was a more laid-back and reserved person in G9-10 who did almost no extracurriculars (apart from music).

      "To Singaporean applicants, especially not from the top JCs, let me tell you that IT IS NOT IMPOSSIBLE! but the thing is that to surmount the odds and get scholarships and admissions to overseas unis is a lot harder given your environment and climate around you. Bear in mind that your competition is not just your fellow students in the 3 top schools, but also the international school students situated in SG. These schools have academic schedules that are more suited for overseas extracurriculars, more funding and resources for activities, guidance counsellors well-versed with the intricacies of the US system and more. It will be a very lonely road ahead of you, where you may be the only one that you know of in the journey of preparing portfolios, essays, recommendations for the US applications. This is compounded with some teachers who often give well-intentioned but sometimes misleading or untrue advice on US applications (I've experienced this first-hand!) because they themselves have had little to no experience dealing with the US application system. For instance, as deceptive as the rankings may be, it takes far more to be admitted to Princeton or Yale than NUS for any applicant, so don't just take what some say at face value. The US application system is a completely different ballgame from anything Singaporeans are normally exposed to. Do your own independent research, take the time to reflect on your own journey (even despite the helter-skelter of A-Levels preparation) and write the best essays that you can. And when you can, seize the opportunity! I got the opportunity to attend and win awards at OxfordMUN and YaleMUN not because I could fly all the way there on my own, but I took advantage during the pandemic to attend these prestigious conferences online (I would never have been able to afford the time off school or the price of just flying to these places otherwise, and my parents weren't really supportive!). I never learnt about these opportunities through the school or someone disseminating the info, but through much digging on the Internet and sourcing information myself, and my biggest regret was not doing that more when I was in school. So take the initiative to find opportunities for yourself! \n",

      " (For context, in SG public schools have academic years based around the calendar year, so summer programs in the US normally coincide with the middle of the school term in SG, which makes it difficult for SG students to attend these programmes. Furthermore, major internal exams are normally held right after school holidays that count towards transcripts to be sent to US colleges, which indirectly gives a tradeoff for US applicants on whether to prioritise extracurriculars and competitions during the holidays or to study for exams. For girls who don't need to serve in the military service, applying to the US is even worse as Early Action deadlines are in the middle of the final preparation towards the A-Levels, and there's only a month between the end of A-Levels and Regular Decision deadline to do all the essays.)\n",

I talked about how in 2021 when Asian hate crimes were on the rise, there was one story in particular that had me terrified for my life as an Asian and it was ironic because that particular story wasn't even really an Asian hate crime: it was road rage and the victim happened to be Asian. I continued to talk about how that spurred me to want to learn and immerse myself more in my culture because I didn't want to lose that connection and if I was going to be scared for my life because of one aspect of my identity, then I better know all that I can about that identity.

      "I think that what probably helped get me into Rice was my sustained interests in writing and the performing arts. Rice sends a personalized banner if you get accepted along the template of \"Name, we can't wait to see how your \\[insert phrase\\] contributes to our community at Rice!\" and mine was \"passion for music and enthusiasm for mental health.\" I took almost 7 credits of arts (visual and performing combined) classes when most students take around 1-2, so I think that continued participation was beneficial. I also think that all of the writing stuff that I did helped, especially considering how I took two English core classes in my senior year. I was one of two students who did that. Of my 10 other electives that I took in senior year, two were writing related and five were arts related. I also think that my LOCI was a big deciding factor in my Rice admission. Emory asked me for a vocal, instrumental, and theatre supplemental because they saw that I did a lot of that on my application as well, but I only submitted a vocal supplement. I never did hear back from them on the outcome of that. Another thing is that we had a lot of college reps visit my school and I went to the meetings for all of the schools I applied to with the exceptions of Emory, Stony Brook, and UH because they didn't come to my school, and also BC because I had a class I couldn't miss during that time. Rice actually came to my school twice, once in May of 2023, and once in November of 2023. I attended both sessions and the lady who came both times was actually my admissions officer. I made sure to make it really clear that Rice was my first choice school both to the AO at those meetings and also in my application. As far as I'm aware, very few students from my school applied to Rice (it's not very well known in the north), and we had a student last year commit to Rice so I think that might've put more eyes on my school which in turn might've helped bolster my chances a bit.\n",

      "English Teacher (10/10): He let me read it and it was incredible. He talked about me in a social light that I hadn’t ever heard expressed about Homecoming King. Was truly an eye opening read.\n",
      "\n",
      "Academic Team Coach (9/10): Less well written but way more personal. Helped build intellectual curiosity. Also one of my favorite people in the world\n",
      "\n",
      "Earth Science Professor (8/10): Family friend who got me engaged in the classroom for the first time in years. The essay was not perfect but it helped showcase my actions in an academic and personal/religious/extracurricular light\n",
      "\n",
      "City Clerk (9/10): Very personal to the point that I don’t feel comfortable sharing, but she is someone I loved. Saw me so far removed from an academic light that I believe it allowed me to shine from a different direction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Interviews\n",
      "\n",
      "Harvard (10/10): Amazing Guy, talked for an hour and a half. Was from the town over and had ties to where my brother went to college. Reached out to the admissions office to see if he could provide an additional recommendation. Biggest regret about not choosing Harvard will be not getting to see this file. Truly one of the best convos I’ve ever had.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yale (6/10): Was with a current senior. Not very memorable, but didn’t go bad. Except for when I said “I’m excited about college because I can focus on what I want to” and she said “it’s a liberal arts school.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Princeton (11/10): Phenomenal. No words. The most eclectic and genuine guy. He was elderly, but he was so encouraging and another amazing convo. This interview made me feel like I had a shot at an Ivy for the first time. Writing the email to let him know I chose Yale was so awful but he was so reassuring. I hope to be like this man one day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Columbia (?/10): No interview, but I was lucky enough to visit prior to apps. Columbia had no after tour meetings but I went to the AO and spoke with an officer and it was awesome. She was a resource throughout the app process and I think she may have played a big part in my acceptance (she and I talked afterward and she was very happy, I wrote a great email about how everyone at Columbia should be more like her…you’re the best Elizabeth Alt!!!)\n",

I liked it and it set up so many feelers for the rest of my app. May not have been the home run, but it set it up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why Essays (10/10 minus Vandy and Harvard the first time): these ate lowkey. I fell in love with these schools and it showed. I connected each schools identity with what I wanted to do and it this isn’t super descriptive but they were and they were deeply personal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cemetery Essay (10/10) This was my home run. Wrote about my summer job working in the cemetery. Such an impactful time and a unique experience. Wrote about how it sparked a joy in people’s stories and our role as historians and links to the past. Even at Yale this is the essay people loves\n",
      "\n",
      "That one architecture essay for Yale (10000/10): Best thing ive ever written. An extended metaphor about the power of architecture and utilized Yale architects (Maya Lin and Errol Sarinen) as key influences. Wrapped it up with a piece about the Gateway arch as a symbol of how architecture can continue to create the best future possible. I legit smile when I read this. Every. Daggum. Time.\n",

      "I am not special. I just obsessed over the admissions process. I figured out who my Yale admissions Officer was and listened to her episode of the Yale admissions podcast probably five times. I used each part of the application to either delve into something I thought needed more explanation or introduced something new, but it always had some basis in what I had written before. It was easy to follow and I had stellar interviews. I also think I presented a very real and genuine picture of myself. I didn’t embellish but I wrote about what I loved and valued. Also underrated tip, make sure the admissions office knows who you are. If I had questions, I emailed them directly as long as they weren’t simple. When I didn’t get interview requests for Princeton or Yale I emailed my admissions officers who gave me the “ it’s just about availability” speech but lo and behold, within a week I had interviews to both. it may seem counterintuitive, but just make sure these admissions officers see you as people, don’t just be a piece of paper, let them know you are a real, intriguing, and valuable addition to their campus.\n",

      "I would be lying if I said I wasn’t disappointed in my results this cycle. I was hoping for at least one reach school, and only ended up getting into one target. Coming from a school that only sends 1-2 kids to a t20 every four years I thought would help give me an advantage, but ig not. In terms of test scores I was in like the top 5 in my grade, and only one other kid ended up going through this cycle, but he managed to sweep some really good schools like Northwestern, USC, Notre Dame, and Princeton. I felt like I did enough to get into a super competitive school because founding clubs and doing research is practically unheard of at my school. I may end up going through this cycle again next year as a transfer student but I’ll cross that bridge when I get there. Ig I also thought karma would help me out a little lol, but turns out it’s not like the AO’s see me taking charge of my health and losing weight :/\n",

Related this to if something matters to me, I don't care what other people think. For why school essays, I just found related programs/research to what I wanted to do. For why major, I talked about combining data-based research (CS) with economic policy. **Ask me in comments if you want to know what I talked about for a specific prompt for a specific school.**\n",

      "I was biased towards Stanford since I REAed, and although I couldn't make it to Admit Weekend, I LOVED campus (along with the weather) when I visited. I never saw myself as a super STEMy kid, so although I'm glad MIT took a chance on me, it wasn't the right school for me. Princeton—spent a summer here, loved it, but honestly I want to double major, and they don't let you. Yale—Bulldog Days was scary since someone literally got shot. Didn't fall in love. Dartmouth/Duke/Columbia/Brown/NYU—kinda out of the picture due to my other choices and what I wanted to do in life.\n",

      "\n",
      "What I would've done differently? Nothing. I loved everything I did throughout highschool and wouldn't trade it for anything. I participated in most of my ECs (except perhaps the Princeton research) because I truly wanted to. I didn't do them for college apps (again except the Princeton research). I think AOs could see this, especially since my rec letters + essays backed it all up. A lot of what I see on this sub (Science Fair + phony non-profits) doesn't always work, especially if you're creating them FOR THE GOAL, rather than the goal being created in relation to what you've done.\n",

Definitely contemplated adding more schools after I submitted all these apps but decided to take my chances after hearing back for interviews.  Speaking of, most of the schools except Bryn Mawr and Dartmouth did not have a positive result even after interviewing so just goes to show how little they help. Anyway, good luck to the next cohort!

      "My overall thoughts:\n",
      "I personally did not expect to get into any of the ivies or top schools, but I wanted to shoot my shot with them anyways. I also think the distribution of my decisions is pretty ironic considering that I ended up at UCLA, but was rejected from schools that are definitely known to be easier to get into. My ECs were not strong and a lot of my application relied on my high academics / GPA, so I was extremely surprised to not get into SDSU or Cal Poly SLO - two schools that only consider academics. When the decisions first started rolling out I was very disappointed because I really wanted to go to UCLA, but was being rejected / waitlisted from much “easier” schools. In the end, it all worked out! I think my results can really attest to the randomness of the whole process and serve as a reminder as to never give up because the colleges are all truly independent of one another and being rejected from one does not indicate anything about another.\n",
      "I’m a middle class white boy with good academics but average ECs and bad awards for the schools that I was gunning for, but I did achieve my tiny LAC dreams and committed to my favorite LAC (sort of) that I applied to. I applied almost exclusively to east coast schools because I was looking for that trademark nerdy intellectual vibe. \n",

      "\n",
      "This teacher was probably the most influential of all of my teachers as I would spend many of my off-hours in his room studying and talking with him. He was very familiar with my accomplishments in high school and could speak well to the things that really didn't have a place to put it on my application (like what I was doing to self-study math and in the independent study for chemistry). He also wrote a rec letter for a scholarship that I applied to the previous year, so he already had a foundation. **9/10**\n",

      "*Debate / AP English Language Teacher*\n",
      "\n",
      "This teacher was probably one of the few teachers in the humanities that I got to form a genuine connection with. I got to know her on a more personal basis my sophomore year in debate class as it had fewer students and a lot of seniors, so it was very laid-back (in fact I wrote my essay about this class lol). The following year, I had her for AP Lang, so in total I had her for a year and a half before she wrote my rec letter. I trust that she wrote a good letter, but I never got to see it. **?/10**\n",
      "\n",
      "*AP Calculus BC Teacher*\n",
      "\n",
      "This guy loved me. I came into his class loving math so he saw my enthusiasm and put a lot of resources in front of me and I sort of just consumed them. He encouraged me to take DE courses on my own (as a sort of \"7th hour\" where our school only does 6) and, even though it didn't work out, he went out of his way to Email old colleagues in several districts so I could take the AMC 12 exam. His letter was very similar to my chemistry teacher's letter, but was more focused on my work in math. He's a UMich alum, so I made sure to use his letter for them. **7/10**\n",

      "*French II Teacher*\n",
      "\n",
      "I took a risk on this one. My French II teacher, whom I had for only a semester freshman year, was the same teacher who taught me French in elementary school all those years ago. I had the opportunity to talk with her a number of times since I took her class and she happened to witness a few \"good deeds\" that I had done around the school (a few I had no clue she was there). This letter sort of \"humanized\" me and differentiated me from the others who had good stats and good grades. More than anything, it was a testament to my character. In hindsight I made a major blunder only using her letter for one school (RIT). I think that had I included her letter instead of my AP Lang teacher's, I would've had a better shot at getting into some of the top schools. **10/10**\n",

      "Princeton - A little bit awkward. The gentleman I spoke to majored in history, which is like the polar opposite of chemical engineering and chemistry. It made it hard to connect on a deeper level, but we were able to connect on the basis of Model UN and the value of involvement in student groups, especially as a leader. **4/10**\n",
      "\n",
      "Cornell - This one went a lot smoother. The man I spoke to was a mechanical engineering major and worked at a facility less than 10 minutes from my home, so we were not only able to connect on the basis of our interests, but I had elite-level small talk based on local things going on. Since he had completed his bachelor's and master's at Cornell, I was able to ask about both programs since I'm considering getting a master's. This was definitely the *ideal* interview from an admissions standpoint had it been counted towards the admissions process. **10/10**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Essays**\n",
      "\n",
      "My essay was on the topic of the flow of knowledge, lessons, and mentorship within a high school environment. I reflected on my experience coming out of COVID. The rest of my school had been in-person for a semester while I had been online for the first semester. Because of this, I was socially \"behind\" and had to form a lot of new connections. Although I had formed plenty of connections by the beginning of my sophomore year, I continued to struggle to create a sense of identity in the social context of high school, but a senior and his friends in my debate class kind of \"took me in\" and mentored me as far as what I should do to be successful in my classes and how to maintain a balance.\n",
      "\n",
      "I didn't know until about a week later, but that student was that class's valedictorian and he had essentially given me all of his advice about what he thinks he did right and all of his regrets in high school, how he would have changed his classes, etc. Beyond academics, though, he taught me how to be a leader. Beyond being val, he was class VP, President of NHS, varsity captain for two sports, among other things. I began to put his words into actions and, along the way, made some modifications. From his advice, over the course of the next two years, I would experience leadership firsthand and would pass that on to my peers in the class of 2026 and 2027.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ultimately, the theme of my essay was about how interaction with your peers and creating communities within a school creates opportunities for well-wishing seniors to pass on their experiences to underclassmen and how it generates a self-sustaining culture of kindness and caring. Finally, I tied this into how I would contribute to a college campus and how my involvement in student groups could create these \"sub-communities\" and, within those, maintain a similar culture of kindness.\n",

I applied for 4 different majors: architecture, design, illustration, and music (classical piano performance).

Stanford only takes around 1 student from PR each year, and I was the only one on the island and the first from my school in 6 years to get in. Yale is a bit more common, but I'm not so sure since I got deferred. Overall however, I'm feeling good about my results because I did get into other top schools like Northwestern and UMich and I feel like I worked a lot to deserve those. Maybe colleges saw my upward trend and high SAT score and saw that to compensate for my low GPA. Anyways, if anyone has any questions or wants to see essays, Hmu!\n",

Also, I will say that evidently, top schools couldn't care less about your course rigor, at least beyond a certain amount. They don't care that you took AP Physics C in elementary school or can speak 10 languages. I went in with the mindset of \"all it takes is one\", though I guess even that was too much to ask for :/ Anyway, my #1 piece of advice?\n",
      "\n",
      "APPLY EARLY. Seriously, I think this was my biggest downfall. I can't believe I didn't learn from my first application cycle, but too late to change that now. THIS APPLIES ESPECIALLY IF YOUR SCHOOL REGULARLY SENDS STUDENTS TO TOP SCHOOLS. It doesn't matter if you have new stuff that you want to show by the regular decision deadline. You can always update stuff in your portal later. If you apply RD, universities may already have selected their share of students from your school. Honestly given how UChicago heavily pads their yield, I might have been accepted had I applied ED there. Or maybe JHU. I don't even know :/\n",
      "\n",
      "I will say though, I think Purdue was an interesting outlier. Even though their engineering program is quite competitive (especially OOS), they specifically reached out to me and asked for my CC dual enrollment grade which no other university did. I think that compelled them to offer me admission, and turning them down was a really hard decision that I still don't even know was the right move. I am extremely grateful for that though.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, I'm honestly feeling quite lost considering all my work, and I’m lowkey considering going to a CC given how burnt out I am. What makes it even worse is that it's looked down upon by every person in my school community and even by my parents and relatives. At least I'll save money, right?\n",
      "\n",
      "Also remember if you're reading this and you didn't get into a top college, DO NOT BE DISCOURAGED. This sub has an INSANE amount of response bias, and posts with titles like \"clutching an ivy\" or \"scored a miracle\" just aren't representative and you shouldn't compare yourself to them. Not everyone gets a satisfactory outcome and you aren't alone. For the sake of your happiness, if you're applying to top universities, just expect to get rejected from all of them. Don't bank on getting into one of them even if you think you are talented or extraordinary in some regard. Chances are that they just don't care. And unless you think you can do something remarkable in a gap year, don't take one just to reapply. It's just not worth it.\n",

      "Anyway, vent over. It doesn't really matter anyway, I'll crush those transfer apps 😌\n",

If I had any advice, just lock in with everything. I had no aims in high school for what I wanted to do, and a lot of the things I did were just because I was friends with more high-achieving people. I had decently good grades (save for freshman year) but almost nothing else. Happy with where I committed though, because I don't really care about prestige that much anymore and just want to develop as a person, plus no undergrad debt is nice. USF also has a BSMD program (not guaranteed, but benchmarks basically give you acceptance into their med school) so I'm also declaring my intent for that, but honestly would be fine also going into research.\n",

To be honest, school comes ridiculously easy for me, and I probably spent \\~2 hours total studying for the SAT and all my AP exams combined. I am just exceptionally lazy and did not put in much effort, partly because I was already demotivated from freshman year.

I basically talked about my experience growing up mixed race and how I won't let race define me. I thought it might be problematic because I said a black girl was being racist to me by mentioning how a black girl once told me I only got straight A's because I was \"white\" and that I realized that some people use race as an excuse for their failures. I said that I thought it was sad she was raised to think that way and ended by saying I wouldn't let my race dictate what I should like or how I should behave and that I would decide for myself rather than following others.\n",

      "I am a high school sophomore (technically a junior since school ends soon) and I go to a very competitive high school in LA suburbs. My class particularly is extremely competitive since my peers have landed internships, summer programs, found non profits, play sports or music internationally etcetc. I know these people most likely started early in their ecs but unfortunately no one guided me and I didn’t even know about college admissions things up until the beginning of my sophomore year. By then, I tried creating a VSA (Vietnamese Student Association) club within my school campus but we didn’t really do much since there wasn’t a wide range of Vietnamese people within our school and an even lesser percentages wanted to join (since everyone was focused on starting their non profits and doing their own initiative). It didn’t really help that the officers I had weren’t very enthusiastic about the club and barely contributed. I kept comparing my club to another new club where in the first year they already raised over 1k and packaged over 100 kits to donate. I am very happy for them but at the same time puzzled and envy them. How did we start off at the same time but they were more successful than my club? I wanted to get new officers the upcoming year but it doesn’t look so promising since I had released an application out but no as much people showed interested and one of my previous officers who actually contributed somewhat to the club, is opting out due to their busy schedule. I am unsure if what to do and I don’t have as many ecs either. I have a lot of ideas to start non profits and clubs but I don’t know what it takes to make them successful and find people who are enthusiastic and are willing to support me and make it grow. I also want to have more ec and deepen my involvement with them. I am willing to put in the dedicated work and time, does anyone have any advice?  \n",
      "It seems like everyone in this community is just insane. Like grades ecs and everything. I’m currently a junior and I am super worried about how everything will turn out next year. I’m a black male from the northeast in a competitive private school and have a 94 gpa and will have taken 9 aps by senior year. I have a 34 act but my ecs suck. They include volunteering at a transitional and reformative living place, a job, teaching children, 2 sports, and leadership in a religious club and vice president of the coding club. I’m super worried because I am no where near the level of applicants in this community. What should I do over the summer? What colleges could I get into with these stats? Are there any realistic results on here that I could look to? Is Umich or Northeastern too far of a reach? I plan to major in cs.\n",

I decided to apply abroad pretty late for the standard I saw (April 2023), and involved a LOT of familiarization with the process. If I don’t get anywhere still I DONT REGRET IT FOR A SECOND: I learnt more english, to manage legal documents and resumes, contact people all over the world,  enhanced writing skills, A LOT OF SELF DISCOVERY AND REFLECTION and controlling challenging deadlines. It also brought me a lot closer to God somehow, and I learnt to at least aim to put my worries in Jesus and trust that everything will go as it should!!! When I was rejected I thought about giving up applying anywhere else (not being even DEFFERED hit somewhat hard), but pretty happy that I continued!!!

      "I'm super grateful and happy with my decisions. I have committed to Princeton, and it definitely is the best fit for me. College results this year were very random, but I couldn’t be more thankful to get into the #1 undergraduate university. I was worried that since most of my application was MIT-related (Research, classes, Letters of Rec, Awards, Activities), other universities would think I was going there and reject me. College results were super random and stressful, but it worked out better than I could have ever imagined. It's funny how I got waitlisted and rejected from all my target schools (Vandy, UMich, USC) but then got into most of my reach schools.\n",

      "Be authentic. There is no formula that gets you in. Sure, you have to do a couple of things like getting good grades and SAT scores and having some unique activities and awards, but especially for Top 10 schools, you just have to be unique and authentic. I didn't have any connections or background (like private school and college counselor) that provided me with opportunities. I was literally the first kid ever from my school to get into Princeton. I was authentic and hardworking, did stuff I enjoyed, and one thing led to another. I also spent a lot of time on essays and my application. 50% of the work is actually doing stuff, and the other 50% is showcasing it in your college application. Also, have balance in life. I had a lot of fun in high school and enjoyed the stuff I did. Live life with no regrets. Feel free to DM me.\n",

      ">!i go to a pretty competitive high school in a relatively wealthy area and learned about the process, got high hopes, and honestly got a little prestige obsessed around my junior year. I had five dream schools (brown, ucla, washu, northwestern, and georgetown) and ended up getting rejected from all of them which was both a total punch in the gut and a much needed wake up call. the decision for me based on fit and financials came down to maryland, washington, and davis, and as a result of the really generous merit aid i recieved at umd as well as the university's perfect location near washington DC, it was just the perfect fit. After visiting the school, I totally fell in love with the campus, the culture, and having a big 10 sports program definitely didn't hurt it. looking back on everything, i was totally naïve and applied to a ton of  schools, which thankfully worked out for my targets, but i was at one point certain that i would get into at least one of my reaches. in the end, im really glad that i didnt get into any of them because i would have never considered maryland, a school i almost didnt even apply to. also, as a jewish student, the thriving jewish community on maryland's campus is really comforting, especially with everything going on right now at colleges. congrats to all of this years seniors and good luck to all the incoming seniors with their apps! and if youre going to maryland next year, hmu!!!!<\n",

I know im kind of rambling, but basically this process doesn't define you and you can and will find reasons to be happy at the college that you get into and decide to go to.

I met amazing people through the process, but common app is definitely  the way to go if you want more space for EC’s , QB for your story.

However, the actual interview went REALLY well, it was clear she just understood me. I talked about the things that truly made me happy, like jazz and badminton. I talked about how I enjoyed science research a lot, particularly presenting (which many people probably dread). She talked about the Duke student life with me a lot, and we got through a lot of stuff in 30 minutes! \n",
      "\n",
      "The only weird thing was that she asked me where I ED'd to (nowhere), and asked me what my top choice was. I actually took a HUGE risk with my answer - I told her that Duke was one of my top 3 schools, but in no particular order because I don't feel like there's only one school where I can be happy, successful, or satisfied at. Duke was one of those schools to me, one where the weather, student life, campus, and academics are great, and that it was a school I could try imagine myself (something I could not say for many of the colleges I applied to). I think she genuinely appreciated the honesty though.\n",

I know that for me, comparison was the biggest thief of joy. Don't let yourself get dragged down too much by the accomplishments of others, because everyone moves at their own pace. However, if you put in the time and effort, results will inevitably follow. I was a good student, but never the smartest. It took me hours upon hours to studying to get the SAT score I wanted, and a lot of the time I spent on my ECs and internship came at the cost of my relationships with friends and family.\n",
