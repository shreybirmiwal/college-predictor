      "This is a subreddit dedicated to compiling data about the undergraduate and transfer admissions processes. We intend to create a repository for information about past applicants and their college decisions, in order for current applicants to browse through examples of student profiles and potentially gauge their chances of admission to different schools and programs. We encourage all students who have received their decisions to contribute to our subreddit by creating a post using our [official templates](https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/gjgqu7/post_templates_and_flairs/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x). To all current applicants, this subreddit is a great resource for you to compare your stats with those of other students, discover ideas on how to improve your extracurriculars and overall application, and discuss student profiles via comments sections. For your convenience, we are organizing both new and archived posts with flairs, according to unweighted GPA, SAT/ACT scores, and intended areas of study. Use these flairs to easily filter through the thousands of posts on our subreddit, based on what you are looking for.\n",

      "Background: Transfer student who was admitted to CS at both UW-Seattle and UMich. The cost will be similar per year (within \\~$8000 of each other), which is not a huge factor for me, and I am only going for two or three years since I am a transfer student. I am curious what the long term-tech career opportunities would be like -- seems like short-term UW gets the advantage since it is in Seattle. Which would you choose specifically for that factor (excluding things like social life, weather, food, campus, etc.)?\n",

      "Seems difficult to pass on UMich since it is overall the better school, whereas UW is kind of a one trick pony with CS, but maybe that doesn't matter?\n",
