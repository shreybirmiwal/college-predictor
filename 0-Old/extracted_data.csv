I reflected on my experience coming out of COVID. The rest of my school had been in-person for a semester while I had been online for the first semester. Because of this, I was socially 'behind' and had to form a lot of new connections. Although I had formed plenty of connections by the beginning of my sophomore year, I continued to struggle to create a sense of identity in the social context of high school, but a senior and his friends in my debate class kind of 'took me in' and mentored me as far as what I should do to be successful in my classes and how to maintain a balance. I didn't know until about a week later, but that student was that class's valedictorian and he had essentially given me all of his advice about what he thinks he did right and all of his regrets in high school, how he would have changed his classes, etc. Beyond academics, though, he taught me how to be a leader. Beyond being val, he was class VP, President of NHS, varsity captain for two sports, among other things. I began to put his words into actions and, along the way, made some modifications. From his advice, over the course of the next two years, I would experience leadership firsthand and would pass that on to my peers in the class of 2026 and 2027. Ultimately, the theme of my essay was about how interaction with your peers and creating communities within a school creates opportunities for well-wishing seniors to pass on their experiences to underclassmen and how it generates a self-sustaining culture of kindness and caring. Finally, I tied this into how I would contribute to a college campus and how my involvement in student groups could create these 'sub-communities' and, within those, maintain a similar culture of kindness.","['University of Michigan (EA) - Committed', 'Cornell University (RD)', 'Georgia Institute of Technology (EA)', 'Michigan Technological University (RD)', 'Purdue University (EA)', 'Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (EA) Deferred -> Accepted RD', 'Rochester Institute of Technology (RD)', 'Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology (EA)', 'University of Toledo (Rolling Admission) (Accepted to Honors College)', 'University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (EA)', 'Western Michigan University (EA)']",['Rice University (RD) Declined Waitlist Offer'],"['Princeton University (RD)', 'Stanford University (RD)', 'The University of Texas at Austin (RD)']",
